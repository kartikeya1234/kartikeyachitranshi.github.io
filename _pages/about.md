I am looking for doctoral positions focused on adversarial machine learning. Till recently, I was a student research assistant at the Zuse Institute Berlin (ZIB) in the [IOL](https://iol.zib.de) group, where I worked with [Shpresim Sadiku](http://shpresimsadiku.com) among others, and under the guidance of [Sebastian Pokutta](https://www.pokutta.com), I completed my Master's thesis. I earned an MSc in Scientific Computing from the [Techische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin), and a BSc in Physical Sciences from the [University of Delhi](https://www.du.ac.in).

### Research Interests
My research focuses on Adversarial Machine Learning, with particular emphasis on three key areas: enhancing the adversarial robustness of multi-modal foundation models, investigating the transferability of adversarial attacks across different machine learning architectures, and mitigating spurious correlations through training methodologies that leverage plausible counterfactuals.
