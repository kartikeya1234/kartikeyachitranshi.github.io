I am looking for doctoral positions focused on adversarial machine learning. Till recently, I was a student research assistant at the Zuse Institute Berlin (ZIB) in the [IOL](https://iol.zib.de) group, where I worked with [Shpresim Sadiku](http://shpresimsadiku.com) among others, and under the guidance of [Sebastian Pokutta](https://www.pokutta.com), I completed my Master's thesis. I earned an MSc in Scientific Computing from the [Techische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin), and a BSc in Physical Sciences from the [University of Delhi](https://www.du.ac.in).

### Research Interests
I am interested in Adversarial Machine Learning. I have worked on problems in the domain of three key research directions: 
- Adversarial robustness of multi-modal foundation models. 
- Transferbility of adversarial attacks. 
- Mitigation of spurious correlations through plausible counterfactuals.
